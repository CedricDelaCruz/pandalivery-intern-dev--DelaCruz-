I learned how to use text-based commands in Ubuntu-WSL that are useful for opening text editors like NANO, and connecting GitHub to the
local repository and then saving files to the cloud repository. The experience with the command terminal has made me more comfortable and 
knowledgable of what to expect with future programming endeavors for Git & Bash.
